Step 1 (HTML Code):

The first step in creating a restaurant website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is to create the basic HTML structure. In this file, we will include the main structure for our restaurant website. This includes creating the necessary HTML tags as well as any other tags that will be used throughout the website. 

Step 2 (CSS Code):


Once the basic HTML structure of the website is in place, the next step is to add styling to the website using CSS. CSS allows us to control the visual appearance of the website, including things like layout, color, and typography.
We will create our CSS file. In this file, we will use some basic CSS rules to create our restaurant website. We will also add some padding and margin properties to ensure that everything looks correct.
